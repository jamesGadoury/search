# best_first

This namespace is mainly for example. Many search algorithms (including uninformed ones) can be implemented in the context of "best first search" through customizing a sorting function f for a priority queue and calling best_first_search. The uninformed algorithms within this namespace may have more optimal variations that are implemented elsewhere, and this namespace is used a simple baseline reference of that algorithm (for example breadth_first_search).
