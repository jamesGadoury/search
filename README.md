# search

These are some simple implementations / prototypes of some search algorithms. Much of the naming is based on the Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach book.

Potentially, this may become a more stable, performant, and maintained library. Another possibility is this stays as a simple set of examples.

## deps

## todos

- Implement Bidirectional search
- Add logging library
- Consider integrating (or implementing?) graph library to use under the hood for search algorithms
